# - log_title: the log title that's gonna pass in title in discord.Embed
# - log_content: the log content that's gonna pass in description in discord.Embed
# - log_color: the color of the embed. It must be self.color_... depend on the current event.
# - log_time: the timestamp of the embed. Typically get from entry.created_at.
# - Optional(executor): the Member that triggered the event.

# Log embed specification:
# Every single embed send here (except raw events) must have the following format:
# Embed.author as the executor.
# Embed.title as log_title.
# Embed.description as log_content.
# Embed.color as log_color.
# Embed.timestamp as log_time.
