# Currency 101

The bot has a dedicated currency system that is heavily inspired by the Minecraft concept. However, because of the Discord limitation, sometimes it can be confusing on where to start or where to progress. This page serve a basic introduction to the overall economic system of MichaelBot.

Don't expect any tips. Just like Minecraft, it is up to each person to decide what to do.

## Money

Every user has a certain amount of money. This is fictional money, and has zero relation to the real life money. Money is global for user, meaning you have the same amount of money across all servers. Money can be a good way to flex on other people of how rich you are. You can get money from the command `daily`, by selling items and by winning games. You can check your balance with `balance`.

## Items

Items play a major role in the currency system. You *need* items to advance further into the system. Some of the early "game" items are `log`, `wood`, `stick`. Items have rarity to see how hard to obtain an item. Some of the items don't have rarity at all, and is displayed as `???`. Many items can be crafted using various materials, but some items are meant to be collected only. You can craft items, use items, buy items, and even sell items for money.

*This is somehow reported by many new users, but like, literally, just use `daily` to start. It's like the start of many economy systems ever existed in Discord.*

### Items Information

MichaelBot provides multiple commands to view and even to perform operations on items. Some of these commands are `craft`, `iteminfo`, and `trade`. Be sure to check out their help for possible subcommands.
