# Currency 103: Nether

Like in Minecraft, MichaelBot also has dimensions (or worlds). Currently, there are 2 worlds: `Overworld` and `Nether`. All users start out in the Overworld, and only from the Overworld can the user travel to different worlds. To access the Nether, a user must have a `Nether Portal` equipped.

Most commands function similarly to as it is in the Overworld. However, some will behave a little differently, which will be addressed further in this page.

## Portal

A portal is a special item in a way that it is *automatically equipped* upon creating it. Similar to a tool, it cannot be unequip, and *only one of each type of portal can be active at once*. A portal has very limited uses before it breaks. You can view its durability with `equipments`.

To travel to another world, a user must have the corresponding portal crafted, then use the command `travelto <destination>` to go to the world. To go back to the Overworld, simply use `travelto Overworld` once again after the cooldown. **This command has a hard-coded 24-hour cooldown.**

## Loot

Each world has its own loot table. For example, a mining session in the Overworld can give you stone, but in the Nether, it will give you netherrack instead.

Nether also contains material to one of the strongest tool type: **netherite**. It is only obtainable through mining with a `diamond pickaxe` or higher in the Nether, and it drops under the form of **ancient debris**. Using ancient debris, the user can craft netherite, which can be used to craft netherite tools. Netherite tools can also have a 25% chance of not disappearing if you die. However, ancient debris is very rare.

`adventure` in the Nether also yield valuable loots. One of the loot is **magma cream**, which is an ingredient for the fire potion. The other is **blaze rod**, one of the required ingredient for any potions.

## Risks

The Nether is notoriously known for its difficulty. Thus, the die chance in the Nether is *doubled* compared to the Overworld. Due to this, plus the fact there's a 24-hour cooldown in travelling, and if you're aiming for ancient debris, it is **highly recommended for the user to stockpile some diamonds**. This chance can be partially negated by the use of potions, which will be discussed in the next page.
