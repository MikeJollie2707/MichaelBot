## Trade

`trade` and `barter` is a more exciting version of `market`. It gives new deals every 4 hours. These deals can be slightly overvalued or undervalued. However, the best thing about these 2 is that it can *buy some non-purchasable items*. Check them out for some fun!

## Potions

Potions are rich people's playground. It massively enhances the effectiveness of activities if used properly. You can not "craft" potions however, you *brew* them. The command `brew` is like the `craft` command, but exclusively for potions. Thus, you can check the ingredient by `brew recipe` subcommand.

Potions are similar to tools, in the sense that they have durability and can be viewed with `equipments`. To use a potion, `usepotion`. A potion has *stacks*. Some potions' effectiveness increase as the stacks increase. The max stack for any potions is 10. Stacks are calculated as `current durability / potion's base durability` rounded up. **You can only use up to 3 different types of potions at a time**.

### Luck Potion

Luck potion is one of the most OP potion. It increases the number of rolls for each activity commands, allowing you to gain more loot and more importantly, more chance of getting rare items. The multiplier is based on its stack. It has a 50% chance of activating.

### Fire Potion

Fire potion is a fairly useful potion in the Nether. When the rng marks you to die in the Nether, the Fire Potion will then have a 25% chance of negating such death. The stack of fire potion does not affect this chance, nor give you any benefits.

### Haste Potion

A fairly useful potion to greatly improve the loot yield from a mining session. It takes the amount of items you're supposed to have (after applying Luck Potion also), and multiply it. The multiplier is based on its stack. It has a 75% chance of activating.

### Looting Potion

A Haste Potion, but for adventure instead. It has the exact same stats as the Haste Potion.
