### Neutral changes

### Comment

The main target for this changes is to significantly hurt the drop chance of many items (for example, diamond). Before, switching from iron pickaxe to diamond pickaxe can increase drop chance up to 10 times theoretically. Now, the scaling should be much lower, but more realistic, of 2 times per rank increment, 5 times is possibly the max. Many items' sell prices are increased to partially compensate this.

The neutral changes for potions is not significant at all, however, in a way, that is a huge nerf. I won't tell why.

### Neutral changes

- `None`.

### Comment

This balance changes is made due to iron's value is way too high despite not having much uses. Additionally, it slightly buff redstone, as it is a hard ingredient to gain for potions. Finally, netherrite deserves more value than it was, hence the massive increase in value.
