# World / Dimension

## Intro

You can think of world as a country in real life. When you move to another country, you'll face a lot more new things. Moving to another world can be seen as moving from early game towards mid game and late game.

## Overworld

By default, all users are in the **Overworld**. If you [dies](death.md), normally, you'd also return to the Overworld. The Overworld is generally beginner-friendly, although some locations are slightly more dangerous if you don't have enough equipments.

## Nether

In the **Nether**, things start to become a lot more dangerous. *In fact, in the earlier version of the bot, the Nether is dangerous even after acquiring most items.* You'll receive new drops which are essential to progress, but you'll also take a lot of damage. In some occasions, *you can die in one hit.* Don't venture too deep into the Nether without preparing enough equipments. If you dies in the Nether, you'll receive the normal penalty on top of being sent back to the Overworld.

Although it'll take a while to sustain in the Nether (for grinding), the Nether is great for speeding up early game. It allows you to use [`barter`](trade.md), which is a more powerful version of [`trade`](trade.md). This can gives you a lot of diamonds and diamond tools without mining.

The Nether is *required* for you to start brewing [potions](potions.md). Potions are game changers, as not only they give you more drops, they also give you some damage reductions. Most notably, *Fire Potion* will prevent you from dying in the Nether for a very cheap recipe.

## End

In the **End**, there's a lot of nothing. You'll more likely to find useless stuff when mining and exploring. On top of that, you'll take a ridiculous amount of damage. Don't even enter the End without at least *Undying Potion* equipped. The penalty for dying in the End is more cruel too: a 95% inventory wipe upon death.

The good part of the End is it has *shulker boxes*, which are required to create safe inventories. Upon joining the End for the first time, you'll receive 3 of them for free. Find more details in [this guide](safe_inventory.md)
