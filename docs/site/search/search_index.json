This can be used as a developer documentation or user documentation. If you want to invite the bot, you won't be able to, yet. You can however, ask MikeJollie#1067 to invite the bot via MichaelBot support server . The source of the bot is available publicly on GitHub . Convention The conventions in this document should be relatively straightforward. The conventions uses in help is a bit less clear, due to not having enough spaces. These are the conventions I use in the help command: Parameters These are the parameter types you will find in the Usage section. <parameter> : Required parameter. The bot will raise error without this parameter . [parameter] : Optional parameter. The bot can still works without this parameter . <param1/param2/...> or [param1/param2/...] : You can provide either param style. If the parameter has space, use \"double quotes\" to make it a param. Example: if it's profile [mention/ID/name/nickname] and the name is Hello World then you will use profile \"Hello World\" . Discord Objects <member> or <user> or <channel> or <guild> are Discord related argument. It is the equivalent of <ID/discrimination/mention/name/nickname> . It is recommended to provide either ID or discrimination (ex: UserName#1234) for absolute accuracy. Providing name or nickname might make the command work not as intended. User/Member Concept User/Member are usually confused terms for a Discord user, but here are the difference. When this document refers to \"user\" , it refers to a Discord user regardless of the server . When this document refers to \"member\" , it refers to a Discord user in a certain server(s) . Note that Discord API doesn't allow bot to get information about a user/member if the bot does not see the user/member , which means the bot needs to share at least 1 server with the user/member to actually work. Prefix This document will assume you know how to use a command using <prefix><command_name> . If you don't know the prefix of the bot, use the bot's mention as the prefix (not recommended) and invoke the prefix command to view the current prefix for the guild. The default prefix is $ when the bot joins a guild, but no it doesn't have $sudo. Permissions The convention for permissions in help is as follow: You need : The required permission you need to have to execute the command. I need : The required permission the bot need to have to execute the command. I will assume the bot always has Send Messages and Read Messages in the channel you use the command. Usually, the bot also needs Read Message History for many commands. Cooldown The convention for cooldown syntax in help is x seconds per n use(s) (cooldown type) . x : The cooldown duration before you can use the command. n : The number of times the command is used before invoking the cooldown. cooldown type : There are usually 4 types of cooldown in this bot: global : The cooldown applies to every servers the bot joins. Example: If a person invokes prefix n times, no one can invoke prefix again until x seconds are passed. guild : The cooldown applies to everyone in a certain server . Example: If a person invokes kick n times, no one in that person's server can invoke kick again until x seconds are passed. user : The cooldown applies to that certain user . Example: If the user MikeJollie invoke embed_simple n times, that certain user can not invoke embed_simple again until x seconds are passed. member : The cooldown applies to that certain member . Example: If the member MikeJollie invoke test n times, that certain member can not invoke MikeJollie in the same server he invoked again until x seconds are passed. He can invoke the command in a different server in that duration however .

The code here is for educational purpose. Nevertheless, I'll still provide you the installation steps. Table of Contents Prerequisite Steps Configure Setup database Install packages Run script Prerequisite It's recommended that you either use Linux or WSL (no idea what this is, but it sounds like Linux inside Windows). Windows instruction is also here, but some might be incorrect because I rarely use it. You need git and python3 (on Windows, it's py -3 ). You should also install pip and virtualenv under python3 . You need PostgreSQL installed and setup (it's pretty complex, and I'm planning to make this optional). Steps Configure Clone this directory. git clone https://github.com/MikeJollie2707/MichaelBot.git Go into folder setup and create a json file (here I use secret.json ). // secret.json { \"token\": \"bot token\", \"host\": \"localhost or wherever you host PostgreSQL\", \"port\": 5432, \"user\": \"username\", \"database\": \"name of the database\", \"password\": \"password\" } In setup , there should also be a config.json file. Open it and fill in necessary information. You can use my bot as the template. // config.json { \"BotIndex\": { \"name\": \"Undecided if optional or not\", \"version\": \"Required\", \"description\": \"Required\", \"prefix\": \"Required\", \"debug\": false, \"secret\": \"secret.json\" } } Setup database Currently this is required. I'm planning to make this optional. You need to have a database created already. It's usually hosted on port 5432. Before running the bot first time, you need to find setupdb.py and run it once so it can create the tables. You only need to do this once, or every time you change the schema. Install packages Next, setup a virtual environment and install the required packages. # Linux python3 -m virtualenv venv source venv/bin/activate python3 -m pip install -r requirement.txt # Windows py -3 -m virtualenv venv .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat pip install -r requirement.txt Finally, run the bot. # Linux python3 bot.py BotIndex # Windows py bot.py BotIndex Run script If you don't like typing python3 bot.py BotIndex all the time when you want to start the bot, there's a script startup.sh (for Linux) and run.ps1 (for Windows Powershell) for convenience. Both of them are currently in setup folder, although it might change. For startup.sh , you can edit MICHAEL_DIR to your current directory, and BOT_INDEX for the bot's index. An absolute path is needed if you plan to put the file to one of the startup application. Mark it executable, and just double click it the next time you want to run. For run.ps1 , just change the $BotIndex , and then open Powershell, run the script using . \".\\run.ps1\" .

As the name suggested, you'll get a certain money and loot everyday. The command has a hard-coded 24-hour cooldown, with another 24-hour window to collect. If you collect before this 24-hour runs out, you will gain a streak. After certain streak milestones, you'll get much better money and loot. However, if you miss out the window, your streak will be reset to 0. Craft Like Minecraft, after you get some materials, you'll eventually need to craft. This can be done using the craft command. You can also use its subcommand to view all possible crafting recipes. The craft command has the following signature: craft [n] <item name> . This will repeat the craft <item name> n times , not crafting n items . This is why it's important to view craft recipe . Example: a log produces 4 wood . When trying to do craft 4 wood , you don't actually craft 4 wood , it's similar to writing craft wood 4 times. Tools Tools are special items that can be used to perform activities . Currently there are 3 types of tools: pickaxe, axe, and sword. They are needed to use mine , chop , and adventure respectively. A tool has a fixed durability. This will wear out gradually as you perform activities. To use a tool, you need to equip with equip . You can check your current equipments with equipments . Once equipped, the tool can be used for the corresponding activity. If you try to equip the same type of tool, the old tool will be swapped out and will have 2 fates: either going back into your inventory (unused) or going to the Void (used). Be sure to check the durability before swapping tools. Activities Activities are a general terms to use when you use mine , chop or adventure . Each activity will give you items that is determined by your corresponding tool. The better the tool, the more loot you will get. There is a small chance of dying while doing these activities. Once you get the death message, all your equipped equipments are destroyed, and you lose 10% of your money as a fee to revive you. Shop The market command is the only way to convert items that you have into money. It also can be used to obtain some materials necessary for future uses. With market alone, you'll see a reaction page to see all the items' prices. With its subcommands market buy and market sell , you can buy or sell items. Inventory At the end of the day, you want to check what items you have. This is achieved with the command inventory . Note that equipped equipments won't show up in the inventory . This also implies that once equipped, the tool can only be used and then later on destroyed.
