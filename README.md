# MichaelBotPy

MichaelBotPy is a bot written in Python using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

The reason why this bot exist is because...I'm free, and I like to make one.

Join the [support server](https://discord.gg/jeMeyNw) to get help.

## Features

- Report and suggest features

- And the best thing is...all features are free-guaranteed.

  - Features like changing volume in Rythm is absolutely pennyless in this bot (meaning you don't have to pay to use this).

## Limitations

- Not bug-free ie. a lot of bugs.
- No support for multi-server yet.

  - By this, I mean that not all commands and features are guaranteed to work properly on multiple servers.

- Uptime not 24/7.

## Development notes

- To run the bot, run the file `DiscordBot.py`.
- To edit categories, look into `categories` folder.
- Do not alter `data` without reasonable reason to do so.
