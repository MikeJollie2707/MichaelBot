# MichaelBot

MichaelBot is a bot written in Python using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

The reason why this bot exist is because...it's fun, and I like to make one.

Join the [support server](https://discord.gg/jeMeyNw) to get help.

Alternatively, you may find what you need in the [bot documentation](https://mikejollie2707.github.io/MichaelBot/).

## Limitations

- Not bug-free ie. a lot of bugs.
- No support for multi-server yet.

  - By this, I mean that not all commands and features are guaranteed to work properly on multiple servers.

- Uptime not 24/7.

## Development notes

I would prefer if you don't run the bot yourself. The source here is for educational purpose.

Nevertheless, the step to run this bot is [here](docs/docs/installation.md) (it's quite complicated).

## License

## Contributing

You can contribute to this bot via:

- Development: I'm doing this all alone, so if I have 1 or 2 more people, that'd be great help.
- Testing: use commands, do actions and report via the `report` command.

Any sort of contributions are highly appreciated.
