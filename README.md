# MichaelBot

## What's this?

This is a utility Discord Bot written in Python using `hikari`, `hikari-lightbulb`, and other libraries. This bot exists because I think it's a fun project.

The bot existed before using `discord.py`, but the library discontinued (and it resumes 3 days after I push the change onto this repository...), so I'm working on rewriting the entire thing with `hikari`. Many important features will be missing in the mean time.

## Features

- Basic Information
- Interactive Help Menu
- Fun Commands
- Utility Commands
- Report and Suggest Features
- Music

More features will be added as I work on to restore the bot to its glory.

## Limitations

- Expect a lot of bugs.
- Uptime not 100% 24/7.

## Libraries

These are the libraries I used. All of these can be installed with `requirement.txt`.

## Resources

These are the resources I used for the bot.

- [hikari Documentation](https://www.hikari-py.dev/hikari/index.html) (a bit hard to follow)
- [lightbulb Documentation](https://hikari-lightbulb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (very useful place to start)
- [lavaplayer Documentation](https://lavaplayer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [XJ9 Bot](https://github.com/kamfretoz/XJ9) (inspiration for `error_handler.py` and a few others)
- [kangakari Bot](https://github.com/IkBenOlie5/Kangakari) (inspiration for a few parts)
- [hikari support server](https://discord.gg/Jx4cNGG) (really chill)
