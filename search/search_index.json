This can be used as a developer documentation or user documentation. If you want to invite the bot, you won't be able to, yet. You can however, ask MikeJollie#1067 to invite the bot via MichaelBot support server . Convention These are the conventions I use throughout this document: Parameters parameter : Required parameter. The bot will raise error without this parameter . [parameter] : Optional parameter. The bot can still works without this parameter . param1/param2/... or [param1/param2/...] : You can provide either param style. The accuracy is in descending order . Example: if it's profile [mention/ID/name/nickname] , means you can, optionally, provide either the mention, the id or the name/nickname of the user. Using mention or id will provide more accuracy than name/nickname . If the parameter has space, use \"this is considered a param\" to make it a param. Example: if it's profile [mention/ID/name/nickname] and the name is Hello World then you will use profile \"Hello World\" . Using profile Hello World will most likely raise error . Permissions You need : The required permission you need to have to execute the command. I need : The required permission the bot need to have to execute the command. This document will asssume the bot has Send Messages and Read Messages in the channel you provoke the command. Prefix This document will assume you know how to provoke a command ~~using prefix command_name ~~. If you don't know the prefix of the bot, use @MichaelBotPy prefix or use the bot's mention as the prefix (not recommended). The default prefix is $ ~~no it doesn't have $sudo~~. User/Member Concept When this document refers to \"user\" , it refers to a Discord user regardless of the server . When this document refers to \"member\" , it refers to a Discord user in a certain server(s) . The difference will be clarified later on in this document. Note that Discord API doesn't allow bot to get information about a user/member if the bot does not see the user/member , which means the bot needs to share at least 1 server with the user/member to actually work. Cooldown The convention for cooldown syntax in this doc (and help ) is x seconds per n use(s) (cooldown type) . x : The cooldown duration before you can use the command. n : The number of times the command is used before invoking the cooldown. cooldown type : There are usually 4 types of cooldown in this bot: global : The cooldown applies to every servers the bot joins. Example: If a person invokes prefix n times, no one can invoke prefix again until x seconds are passed. guild : The cooldown applies to everyone in a certain server . Example: If a person invokes kick n times, no one in that person's server can invoke kick again until x seconds are passed. user : The cooldown applies to that certain user . Example: If the user MikeJollie invoke embed_simple n times, that certain user can not invoke embed_simple again until x seconds are passed. member : The cooldown applies to that certain member . Example: If the member MikeJollie invoke test n times, that certain member can not invoke MikeJollie in the same server he invoked again until x seconds are passed. He can invoke the command in a different server in that duration however .
